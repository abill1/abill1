- Hi, I’m Anthony @abill1
- I’m interested in game development and game engine development primarily. I am a graduate student at DePaul University pursuing a Game Programming MS
- I’m currently working on improving my Unreal Engine 4 knowledge and exploring game engine development focused on the Windows platform using DirectX11 to start.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting honestly, but anything game related preferably.
